## **1. What kinds of aquatic weeds do you remove?**

We specialize in removing **rooted aquatic weeds**, particularly invasive species such as **hydrilla**, that interfere with docks, swim areas, and shoreline access.

We focus exclusively on **physical, root-based removal**. We do not cut weeds at the surface, and we do not provide services that leave roots or fragments behind. Our goal is to remove as much of the plant—including the root system—as possible to reduce regrowth.

Learn more about [the benefits of manual aquatic weed removal](/blog/manual-aquatic-weed-removal) and why root-based methods are more effective than cutting.

## **2. What is hydrilla and why is it such a problem?**

Hydrilla (*Hydrilla verticillata*) is a **highly invasive, non-native aquatic plant** that spreads aggressively in Texas lakes. It forms dense underwater mats, grows rapidly toward the surface, and can block access to docks, boat lanes, swimming areas, and shoreline intakes.

Hydrilla spreads easily through fragments. Even small pieces left behind can regrow into new plants, which is why improper removal methods often make the problem worse rather than better.

For an in-depth look at this invasive species, read our guide: [Understanding Hydrilla: The Most Invasive Aquatic Weed in Austin Lakes](/blog/understanding-hydrilla).

---

## **3. Why don't you cut weeds like other lake weed removal companies?**

Cutting weeds removes only the visible portion of the plant and **leaves the root system intact**. With invasive species like hydrilla, cutting also creates fragments that can float away and establish new infestations.

Our approach focuses on **manual root extraction**, which significantly reduces regrowth compared to cutting alone. While no method can permanently eliminate hydrilla from a lake, removing the plant by the root provides longer-lasting results and avoids fragment-driven spread.

## **4. Do you use divers or heavy machinery?**

**No.**

* We **do not use divers**
* We **do not use mechanical harvesters**
* We **do not use cutters, dredges, or heavy equipment**

All weed removal is done **manually using hand tools such as rakes**, allowing us to extract weeds carefully by the root while minimizing fragmentation and disturbance to the lake bottom.

---

## **5. Do you work on lake pumps or pump intake systems?**

**No.**

We **do not service, repair, or install lake pumps or pump intake systems**.

If weeds are growing *around* a pump intake, we can manually remove vegetation in that area up to—but not including—the pump hardware itself. Any mechanical or electrical pump work should be handled by a licensed pump or irrigation contractor.

---

## **6. Are you insured?**

**Yes.**

Austin Lake Management is **fully insured** for aquatic weed removal services. Our insurance covers on-site operations and vegetation removal work. Proof of insurance can be provided upon request.

---

## **7. What does your weed removal process look like?**

Our process is straightforward and site-specific:

**a)** Evaluate the infestation (dock area, swim zone, shoreline edge, cove, etc.)

**b)** Identify weed type and growth pattern

**c)** Manually extract weeds **by the root** using hand tools

**d)** **Remove as much of the plant material as possible**, collect it, and remove it from the water

Because invasive aquatic weeds grow in complex root networks and sediment conditions vary, **it is not possible to remove every single plant**. We can often get very close, but complete eradication is not realistic in open water systems. Our goal is to remove **as much biomass and root structure as possible** to significantly reduce regrowth and restore usable water areas.

## **8. How much does lake weed removal cost?**

Pricing depends on the **scope and complexity of the infestation**.

* Smaller residential projects can start around **$2,000**
* Large estates, multi-lot properties, or extensive shoreline projects can range **up to $7,000 or more**

Key factors that affect pricing include:

* **Water depth**
* **Density of weed growth**
* **Total shoreline length**
* **How far out into the water the infestation extends**

Because every lake and property is different, we provide **site-specific evaluations and custom quotes** rather than flat pricing. This ensures you pay for the actual work required—not a generic estimate.

## **9. How soon will weeds grow back after removal?**

Regrowth timelines vary widely and depend on several factors:

* Water depth (shallow areas regrow faster)
* Sunlight exposure
* Seasonal growth conditions
* Nearby infestations that can spread fragments

In shallow, sunny areas during peak growing season, regrowth can occur in **2–3 months**. In deeper water or during slower growth periods, regrowth may take **4–6 months or longer**.

Root-based removal slows regrowth significantly compared to cutting, but hydrilla is persistent and ongoing monitoring is recommended.

## **10. What are benthic barriers and how do they work?**

**Benthic barriers** are weighted, permeable mats installed on the lake bottom to **block sunlight and suppress new plant growth**. They are commonly used around docks, swim zones, and high-use shoreline areas.

Key points about benthic barriers:

* They prevent new growth by blocking light
* They do not rely on chemicals
* They are best used in targeted areas, not entire shorelines
* Proper sizing, anchoring, and placement are critical

Benthic barriers are often most effective when combined with **initial weed removal**, followed by barrier installation to prevent regrowth in priority areas.

For a deeper explanation, see our [complete guide to benthic barriers](/blog/benthic-barriers-guide) and explore our [benthic barrier services page](/benthic-barriers).

## **11. Do you use herbicides or chemicals?**

**No.**

We do **not use chemical herbicides** or aquatic pesticides. Our services are entirely physical and manual, avoiding chemical exposure to fish, wildlife, and water users.

---

## **12. Will your work harm fish or wildlife?**

Our hand-tool, root-based approach is designed to be **low-impact**. Because we avoid chemicals and heavy machinery, there is minimal disturbance to sediment, oxygen levels, and aquatic habitat.

---

## **13. Do you need access to my yard?**

In most cases, **no**.

We perform the majority of our work **from our boat**, accessing problem areas directly from the water. In some situations—such as hard-to-reach areas—we may work **from the dock**, but we generally do not need to enter your yard.

If special access is required, we'll discuss it with you in advance.

---

## **14. Do I need to be home during the service?**

**No.**

As long as we have dock or water access and prior approval, you do not need to be present during the work.

---

## **15. Do you guarantee weeds won't come back?**

We do not offer permanent guarantees against regrowth. Invasive aquatic weeds like hydrilla can return due to environmental factors beyond any contractor's control.

What we *do* guarantee is that we remove weeds using methods proven to reduce regrowth more effectively than cutting alone and without introducing chemicals into the water.

---

## **16. How do you identify hydrilla versus other aquatic plants?**

Hydrilla is identified by its distinctive growth pattern, including **whorled leaves with small teeth along the midrib** and dense underwater growth. If needed, we can assist with identification using photos or an on-site evaluation.

Check out our detailed guide: [Understanding Hydrilla: The Most Invasive Aquatic Weed in Austin Lakes](/blog/understanding-hydrilla).

---

## **17. Do I need a permit for aquatic weed removal in Texas?**

Permit requirements depend on the scope of work, location, and local regulations. In many cases, manual weed removal may not require permits, but it's important to verify with local authorities.

For detailed information about permitting requirements, see our guide: [Navigating Permitting for Aquatic Vegetation Removal in Texas](/blog/navigating-permitting).
