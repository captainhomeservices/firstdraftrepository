# Understanding Hydrilla: The Most Invasive Aquatic Weed in Austin Lakes

If you've searched for **Austin sea weed** control or wondered about **lake weed removal** options, you might be surprised how much damage one invasive plant can cause. Hydrilla (*Hydrilla verticillata*) is one of the most problematic aquatic weeds in lakes and reservoirs across the United States, and Austin-area lakes are no exception. Drawing on research from leading institutions, including LSU AgCenter and the University of Florida's Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants, here is an in-depth look at hydrilla, how it spreads, why it's so hard to manage, and how lake managers here in Austin can address it.

## What Is Hydrilla and Where Did It Come From?

Hydrilla is native to Asia, Australia, and parts of Africa but was introduced to North America as an aquarium plant. Over time, it escaped into natural waterways—reportedly first discovered in Florida in the 1950s—and since then has spread to many states, thriving in a wide variety of water bodies including lakes, ponds, rivers, and canals. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)

According to the University of Florida's Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants, hydrilla is now considered one of the world's worst aquatic weeds. The plant has established itself in water bodies across the southern United States, including **Lake Austin**, **Lake Travis**, and other Highland Lakes. [<sup>2</sup>](#ref2)

What makes hydrilla such a menace is its ability to take root from fragments, its rapid growth, and its capacity to form dense mats that shade out native plants and interfere with all kinds of aquatic uses. A tiny piece broken off by a boat propeller or trailer can float downstream, take root, and lead to a new infestation. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)

## How Hydrilla Grows and Spreads

Hydrilla is capable of growing in water up to 25 feet deep and in very low light conditions—meaning even in relatively deep parts of a lake, it can thrive. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1) Once established, it grows upward toward the surface and can form thick mats of vegetation that block sunlight, reduce oxygen levels, and outcompete native aquatic plants.

### Multiple Reproduction Methods

One of the reasons hydrilla is so difficult to control is its multiple pathways for reproduction:

- **Stem Fragments**: Small pieces of stems can drift to new areas and develop roots and shoots [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)
- **Tubers**: Underground storage structures that can survive harsh conditions and produce thousands of new tubers per square meter [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)
- **Turions**: Overwintering buds that form along the stems and can remain dormant in sediment [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)

This reproductive versatility means that eradicating hydrilla is extremely difficult once it's established. Each reproduction method requires different control strategies, and missing just one can lead to rapid reinfestation.

## The Real-World Impact on Austin Lakes

The impacts of hydrilla infestations are many and serious. Dense hydrilla growth restricts boating, swimming, and fishing. It clogs intake pipes, interferes with shoreline aesthetics, lowers property values, and can alter water chemistry. In severe cases, decaying mats consume dissolved oxygen, leading to fish kills. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)

### Safety Concerns

In 2023, KXAN News reported on concerning incidents at Lake Pflugerville, where swimmers experienced entanglement in dense aquatic vegetation. [<sup>3</sup>](#ref3) While hydrilla can grow in recreational areas throughout Austin, these incidents highlight the safety risks associated with uncontrolled aquatic vegetation growth.

The Austin American-Statesman has documented ongoing challenges with hydrilla management in **Lake Austin** and **Lake Travis**, noting that the invasive weed continues to impact recreational activities and property values along Central Texas waterways. [<sup>4</sup>](#ref4)

### Economic Impact

For lakefront property owners, hydrilla infestations can significantly decrease property values and limit enjoyment of waterfront access. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department estimates that aquatic invasive species cost Texas millions of dollars annually in management costs, lost recreation opportunities, and property devaluation.

## Control Methods: What Works for Austin Lakes

Control of hydrilla typically requires an integrated approach. No single method has proven sufficient to completely eliminate established hydrilla populations, but several approaches can provide effective management.

### Mechanical Removal

Mechanical removal (cutting or harvesting) can help in small infestations but has risks: cut fragments left behind can contribute to new growth. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1) Large-scale mechanical harvesting equipment is often too cumbersome for residential waterfront areas and can actually spread the problem by creating fragments.

**Manual precision removal**, however, offers a more targeted approach. By carefully extracting entire plants including root systems and tubers, manual removal minimizes fragmentation while providing immediate, visible results in dock and swimming areas.

### Water Level Management

Water level drawdowns can expose plants so they die, but that's not always feasible for deeper or continuously filled lakes like **Lake Austin**. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1) The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) manages water levels in the Highland Lakes, and coordinated drawdowns for vegetation management are rare and require extensive planning.

### Chemical Control

Chemical control with aquatic herbicides is commonly used, especially in combination with other methods. But herbicides usually only suppress hydrilla—they rarely eliminate it entirely, especially because tubers deep in the sediment can survive treatments. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)

The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) regulates all herbicide applications in public waters, and property owners must obtain proper permits before applying any chemical treatments. Many Austin-area homeowners prefer to avoid chemical treatments due to concerns about water quality, fish health, and recreational safety.

### Biological Control: Grass Carp

One of the more well-known biological methods is the use of **sterile grass carp** (triploid grass carp) to graze on aquatic vegetation. Where properly stocked and managed, they can help suppress hydrilla growth. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)

The Austin American-Statesman reported on LCRA's use of sterile grass carp in Highland Lakes as part of a long-term aquatic vegetation management strategy. [<sup>5</sup>](#ref5) However, grass carp introduction requires special permits from TPWD and is typically only approved for whole-lake management programs, not individual property owners.

Other biological agents—such as certain weevils, moths, or insects that specialize in feeding on hydrilla—have also been explored, though their application can be limited by specificity, timing, and ecosystem balance constraints. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)

## Prevention: The Most Important Strategy

One golden rule in managing hydrilla is prevention. Once established, hydrilla is incredibly difficult and expensive to control. The "Clean, Drain, Dry" protocol is essential for all boaters:

- **Clean** all visible aquatic plants, animals, and mud from your boat, trailer, and equipment [<sup>6</sup>](#ref6)
- **Drain** water from your boat, motor, livewells, and bilge before leaving the launch area [<sup>6</sup>](#ref6)
- **Dry** your boat and equipment completely before entering another water body [<sup>6</sup>](#ref6)

Texas Parks and Wildlife Department actively promotes these prevention measures to slow the spread of hydrilla and other invasive species between water bodies. Cleaning boats, trailers, motors, fishing gear, and draining and drying all equipment between water bodies helps prevent spreading fragments from lake to lake. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)
